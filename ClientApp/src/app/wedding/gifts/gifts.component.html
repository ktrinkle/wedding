<h1>Gifts</h1>
<p>Look. We know almost everyone is traveling to the venue. We also know that we have a full house, with a fully equipped
  kitchen (Kevin insists on that) and more computers than we know what to do with. So we're making this easy.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We're not registered at any store.</li>
    <li>All we want is money towards the honeymoon fund.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where is the honeymoon?</h2>
  <p>Moorea, French Polynesia (airport code MOZ).</p>
  <p>Or, for those who don't know, it's Tahiti. Just a different island.</p>

  <h2>How do I contribute my gift?</h2>
  <p>Kevin still needs to figure this out.</p>
